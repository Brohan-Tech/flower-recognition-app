# Flower Recognition CNN Web App

This project is a **deep learning-based flower recognition system** built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed using **Streamlit**.  
The app allows users to upload an image of a flower and get predictions across 5 categories: **daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, tulip**.

---

## Features

- Upload an image via the Streamlit interface  
- Classifies the image into one of five flower categories  
- Displays the predicted class and confidence score  
- Powered by a custom-trained CNN model  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+  
- TensorFlow / Keras â€“ Deep learning framework  
- NumPy â€“ Numerical computations  
- Streamlit â€“ Web app UI

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brohan-Tech/flower-recognition-app.git
cd flower-recognition-app
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser (default: `http://localhost:8501`)  
2. Upload an image of a flower  
3. The model will predict its category and show a confidence score  

---

## Model Training

The CNN model was trained in **`Flower_recog_Model.ipynb`** using the `flower_photos` dataset.  
The final model is saved as **`.keras`** and loaded in `app.py`.

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand to more flower categories   
- Deploy on **Streamlit Cloud / AWS / Heroku** for public access  
- Add visualization of training accuracy/loss  
- Show prediction probability distribution (bar chart)
